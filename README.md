# Hi!✌️
Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a rising Senior at Villanova University majoring in Computer Science pursuing minors in Geography, and History. In addition to my studies I am the Head Resident Assistant of two Residence Halls, a Tutor for CS and Geography, a Learning Communitity 4th Hour Facilitator, and the Vice President of Villanova's Marvel Watch Club (the Watchers). This summer I am a Data Science intern @ Prorizon in London.

# Who Am I?
I am a detail oriented and creatively driven person who thrives in teams and loves nothing more than a good idea and to watch others around me grow. In my free time I enjoy watching/playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also love listening to music/podcasts, writing poetry, and learning new things about the world and the universe.
