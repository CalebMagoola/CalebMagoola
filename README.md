# Hi!✌️
Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a Villanova University M.S. of Software Engineering Student c.o. 2027, looking to specialize/study geospatial technologoies. I am also a Villanova alum with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Geography, and History (c.o 2024). I currently am serving as the Graduate Resident Director of one of our Residence Halls and a Computer Science/Geography Tutor. As an undergrad student I worked throughout the summer of 2023 as a SWE Intern @ Prorizon in London, was 1 of 15 Villanova in the Valley participants in the Winter 2023 cohort, and was an attendee of the Blackstone Diverse Innovators Program as 1 of 40 selected participants nationally. 

# Who Am I?
I am detail oriented and creatively driven, thrive in team settings, and a love nothing more than a good idea. In my free time I enjoy watching/playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also enjoy listening to music/podcasts, creative writing, and learning new things about the world and beyond.
