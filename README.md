# Hi!✌️
Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a Villanova University alum with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Geography, and History. I graduated in May 2024. As a student, I was the Head Resident Assistant of two Residence Halls, a Tutor for CS and Geography, and a Learning Communitity 4th Hour Facilitator. In the summer of 2023 I was a SWE Intern @ Prorizon in London.

# Who Am I?
I am a detail oriented and creatively driven person who thrives in teams and loves nothing more than a good idea and to watch others around me grow. In my free time I enjoy watching/playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also love listening to music/podcasts, writing poetry, and learning new things about the world and the universe.
