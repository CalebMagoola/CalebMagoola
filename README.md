# Hi!✌️
Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a Junior at Villanova University majoring in Computer Science pursuing minors in Geography, and History. In addition to my studies I am a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures I, a Tutor for CS, Geography, and French, and a 2nd year Resident Assistant for Freshmen students.

# Who Am I?
I am a detail oriented and creatively driven person who thrives in teams and loves nothing more than a good idea and to watch others around me grow. In my free time I enjoy watching/playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also love listening to music/podcasts, writing poetry, and learning new things about the world and the universe.
