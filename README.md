Hi!✌️

Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a Junior at Villanova University majoring in Computer Science with minors in History and Geography. I started coding in August 2021, and haven't looked back since! In addition to my studies I am a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures I, a Tutor for CS, Geography, and French, and a 2nd year Resident Assistant for Freshmen students.

In my free time I'm a big fan of watching and playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also love listening to music/podcasts, writing poetry, and learning new things about the world and beyond.
