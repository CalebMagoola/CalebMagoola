# HI!✌️

Thanks for visiting my Github page. I'm Caleb Magoola, a Rising Junior at Villanova University double majoring in Computer Science and Geography. In addition to my studies I am a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures I, a Tutor for CS, Geography, and French, and a 2nd year Resident Assistant for Freshmen students.

# Who Am I?
In my free time I deeply enjoy watching/playing sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Ultimate, etc.), reading, and playing puzzle/trivia games like sudoku and nonograms. I also love listening to music/podcasts, writing poetry, and learning new things about the world and space.
